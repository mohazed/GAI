# P-21 light protocol: the description of the review (PR #11)

The P-21 sessions (PROMPTS.md "P-21", three countries per session) do not open one pull request each. Every session commits to `data/phase1` and appends its summary here, so that the author reviews the whole dataset in PR #11 (docs/10 B-500). Each section has a table of the events the session filed (event id, indicator, date, points, confidence, the kind of the first source), then, per country, the assessment counts and the 90-minute stop note. Every event is at status `reviewed`; none is published, and no `review.reviewed_by` is set. Scores quoted are `pnpm score --preview` figures on the unpublished events and are provisional.

## T-P21-01: NZL, KAZ, KGZ (2026-10-05)

Light protocol (docs/06 §5) for New Zealand, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. 19 events: 13 for New Zealand, 5 for Kazakhstan, 1 for Kyrgyzstan. Decisions and flags are in docs/10 B-500 to B-507.

Points are the tier points before decay and weights. B1, D1 and the other generated indicators are left to the build.

### New Zealand

Assessments (34 indicators): has-events 6 (B1, B5, B9, B11, D1, D3), none-found 16, no-data 2 (A2, C3), not-applicable 1 (B2), unchecked 9 (A3, A5, A7, A8, C2, C6 and the three experimental E1 to E3). Leads: 1 (`lead_20261005_NZL_1`, B9). Sources read: the Ministry's page with its frequently asked questions (archived), the Beehive releases and transcripts (through Wayback captures), the General Debate statements, and the joint statements already archived for the 45 (7 of them name New Zealand). The EU Council listings do not apply. 90-minute stop note: the work finished inside the budget (about 45 minutes in all for the three countries, 25 of them on New Zealand); nothing was cut for time except what the protocol does not search (A3, A5, A7, A8, C2, C6).

### Kazakhstan

Assessments: has-events 5 (B1, B9, C2, D1, D3), none-found 13, no-data 2 (A2, C3), not-applicable 1 (B2), unchecked 13 (A3, A5 to A8, B8, C1, C4 to C6, E1 to E3). Leads: 1 (`lead_20261005_KAZ_1`, C2 and D4, D5 notes). Joint statements: none of the statements already archived names Kazakhstan. 90-minute stop note: finished inside the budget (about 10 minutes on Kazakhstan). The Ministry's releases cannot be archived as text (B-501): the C2 events rest on two press reports at `corroborated`.

### Kyrgyzstan

Assessments: has-events 2 (B1, B9), none-found 16, no-data 2 (A2, C3), not-applicable 1 (B2), unchecked 13 (A3, A5 to A8, B8, C1, C4 to C6, E1 to E3). Leads: 1 (`lead_20261005_KGZ_1`, B9). Joint statements: none of the statements already archived names Kyrgyzstan. 90-minute stop note: finished inside the budget (about 8 minutes on Kyrgyzstan). Neither the Ministry's site (HTTP 502 to scripted requests) nor the President's site (script-loaded) could be read directly.

### Score effects (provisional)

`pnpm score --country X --preview` on 2026-10-05 (methodology 1.0.0-rc.1), the 19 reviewed events scored as if published; before them the generated indicators alone gave +3 (Acting) for each of the three countries.

| Country | Before (generated only) | With the reviewed events | Band | What moves it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NZL | +3 | +37 | Acting | B5 +8, B11 +10, D3 +8, B9 +7.9 (the statements of 2025), passivity penalty (−15) applied: no qualifying event in the last 365 days |
| KAZ | +3 | +14 | Acting | C2 −14 (two events at weight 0.7), D3 +8, B9 +2.0; the C2 events are qualifying, so the passivity penalty (−15) no longer applies |
| KGZ | +3 | +7 | Acting | B9 +4.9, passivity penalty (−15) still applied |

No band changes. One reading to note for the author: Kazakhstan's two C2 events (−14 in all) end its passivity penalty (+15), so the score with them is 1 point above the score without them (B-504 (2)).

## T-P21-02: TJK, TKM, UZB (2026-10-05)

Light protocol (docs/06 §5) for Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. 8 events: 3 for Tajikistan, none for Turkmenistan, 5 for Uzbekistan. Decisions and flags are in docs/10 B-508 to B-514.

| Event id | Ind. | Date | Points | Confidence | Source kind |

Points are the tier points before decay and weights. B1, D1 and the other generated indicators are left to the build.

### Tajikistan

Assessments (34 indicators): has-events 3 (B1, B9, C2), none-found 16, no-data 2 (A2, C3), not-applicable 1 (B2), unchecked 12 (A3, A5 to A8, B8, C4 to C6 and the three experimental E1 to E3). Leads: 2 (`lead_20261005_TJK_1`, B9; `lead_20261005_TJK_2`, B5). Sources read: the Ministry's English pages (news, statements of 2025 and 2026, the President's speeches), the General Debate statements of the 79th and 80th sessions, the UN's transcript of the 81st session's Day 5 sitting, the Israeli Government's news item on the tourism visit. The EU Council listings do not apply and no archived joint statement names Tajikistan. 90-minute stop note: finished inside the budget (about 30 minutes on Tajikistan). The Foreign Minister's call for a lasting ceasefire at the 81st session (26 September 2026) is in the UN's transcript, which the archiver truncates before that passage, and the Ministry's own page is a summary without it: a lead, not an event (B-509).

### Turkmenistan

Assessments: has-events 1 (B1), none-found 18, no-data 2 (A2, C3), not-applicable 1 (B2), unchecked 12 (A3, A5 to A8, B8, C4 to C6, E1 to E3). Leads: 1 (`lead_20261005_TKM_1`, B9). No event: the General Debate statements read (the Foreign Minister's of 2024, the President's of 2025) have no passage on Gaza, and the Ministry's statements of 2026 concern Iran. No archived joint statement names Turkmenistan; the EU Council listings do not apply. 90-minute stop note: finished inside the budget (about 12 minutes on Turkmenistan).

### Uzbekistan

Assessments: has-events 4 (B1, B9, D1, D3), none-found 15, no-data 2 (A2, C3), not-applicable 1 (B2), unchecked 12 (A3, A5 to A8, B8, C4 to C6, E1 to E3). Leads: 2 (`lead_20261005_UZB_1`, B6; `lead_20261005_UZB_2`, D4). No archived joint statement names Uzbekistan; the EU Council listings do not apply. 90-minute stop note: finished inside the budget (about 25 minutes on Uzbekistan). The President's site publishes the full English texts of his addresses, which is why four of the five events rest on it.

### Score effects (provisional)

`pnpm score --country X --preview` on 2026-10-05 (methodology 1.0.0-rc.1), the 8 reviewed events scored as if published; before them the generated indicators alone gave +3 (Acting) for Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and −2 (Passive) for Turkmenistan.

| Country | Before (generated only) | With the reviewed events | Band | What moves it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TJK | +3 | −5 | Passive | C2 −10, B9 +2.0 (the statement of 2025; that of 2024 has decayed to zero), passivity penalty (−15) applied: no qualifying event in the last 365 days |
| TKM | −2 | −2 | Passive | no event; the passivity penalty (−15) applies |
| UZB | +3 | +7 | Acting | B9 +4.2 (2024, July and September 2025), D3 ended on 2024-12-31 and no longer counts, passivity penalty (−15) applied |

One band change: Tajikistan moves from Acting to Passive on the C2 event. Two unfiled items would each end a passivity penalty: the Tajik Foreign Minister's statement of 26 September 2026 (a lead, +2 and a qualifying event: the score would be about +12) and, for Uzbekistan, nothing found within 365 days that meets the evidence rule. Read critically (docs/06 §4 step 7): no cap is hit; the bands rest on one tourism instrument for Tajikistan (B-510 (2)).

## T-P21-03: MNG, PRK, BGR (2026-10-05)

Light protocol (docs/06 §5) for Mongolia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Bulgaria. 8 events: none for Mongolia, none for the DPRK, 8 for Bulgaria. Decisions and flags are in docs/10 B-515 to B-522.

| Event id | Ind. | Date | Points | Confidence | Source kind |

Points are the tier points before decay and weights. B1, D1 and the other generated indicators are left to the build.

### Mongolia

Assessments (34 indicators): has-events 1 (B1), none-found 18, no-data 2 (A2, C3), not-applicable 1 (B2), unchecked 12 (A3, A5 to A8, B8, C4 to C6 and the three experimental E1 to E3). Leads: none. Sources read: the President's General Debate statements of the 79th and 80th sessions (archived; no passage on Gaza, Palestine or the Middle East), the generated events and tables, UNRWA's donor tables (no row), web searches in English and Mongolian per indicator group. The Ministry's own pages could not be read (the site redirects to a Government-portal page that answers 404, B-515 (2)). The EU Council listings do not apply and no archived joint statement names Mongolia. 90-minute stop note: finished inside the budget (about 5 minutes on Mongolia).

### Democratic People's Republic of Korea

Assessments: has-events 1 (B1), none-found 18, no-data 2 (A2, C3), not-applicable 1 (B2), unchecked 12 (A3, A5 to A8, B8, C4 to C6, E1 to E3). Leads: 1 (`lead_20261005_PRK_1`, B9). No event: the DPRK's words on Gaza come from its General Debate delegation (an Ambassador in 2024, a Vice Foreign Minister in 2025), the Foreign Ministry's unnamed spokesperson and remarks attributed to Kim Jong Un, none a B9 speaker with a named, exact-words statement (R3, R4; B-518). Both General Debate texts are archived (the 2025 one in Korean). No archived joint statement names the DPRK; the EU Council listings do not apply. 90-minute stop note: finished inside the budget (about 5 minutes on the DPRK); KCNA's own archive cannot be searched by a script, so a statement of the Foreign Minister herself, if one exists, was not found.

### Bulgaria

Assessments: has-events 5 (B1, B9, B11, D1, D3), none-found 14, no-data 2 (A2, C3), not-applicable 1 (B2), unchecked 9 (A3, A5 to A8, B8, C4 to C6; E1 to E3 experimental). Leads: 4 (`lead_20261005_BGR_1`, B6; `_2`, B10; `_3`, C2; `_4`, B9). Sources read: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' releases (through Wayback captures: the site answers a scripted request with a bot check), the Council of Ministers' release on the visit of November 2023 (archived), the General Debate statements of the 78th to 80th sessions, the two joint statements already archived that name Bulgaria (19 February and 6 June 2024), the Council's three settler listings (R8), UNRWA's donor tables and web searches in English and Bulgarian per indicator group. 90-minute stop note: finished inside the budget (about 15 minutes on Bulgaria). Not filed and why: B10 for the Prime Minister's visit of 6 November 2023 (the "full support" wording is the release's own, R4), B5/B6 for the Ministry's criticism of the ICC warrants (no position on executing them, no named speaker), C2 for a health cooperation plan of November 2024 (implements an existing agreement, R18).

### Score effects (provisional)

`pnpm score --country X --preview` on 2026-10-05 (methodology 1.0.0-rc.1), the 8 reviewed events scored as if published; before them the generated indicators alone gave −11 (Passive) for Bulgaria and +3 (Acting) for Mongolia and the DPRK.

| Country | Before (generated only) | With the reviewed events | Band | What moves it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MNG | +3 | +3 | Acting | no event |
| PRK | +3 | +3 | Acting | no event |
| BGR | −11 | +11 | Acting | B11 +5.0 (listing of 15 July 2024), B9 +2.0 (statement of 2025), B1 +3.6; the passivity penalty (−15) no longer applies, the Council's listing of 28 May 2026 being a qualifying event |

One band change: Bulgaria moves from Passive to Acting. Without the 28 May 2026 listing, which adds no points (one event per tier), the penalty would apply and the score would be −4 (Passive): the band rests on the EU listings counted under R8, as it does for the 15 EU members among the 45 (B-446). No cap is hit.

## T-P21-04: BLR, MDA, ROU (2026-10-05)

Light protocol (docs/06 §5) for Belarus, the Republic of Moldova and Romania. 15 events: none for Belarus, 4 for Moldova, 11 for Romania. Decisions and flags are in docs/10 B-523 to B-531.

Points are the tier points before decay and weights. B1, D1 and the other generated indicators are left to the build.

### Belarus

Assessments (34 indicators): has-events 1 (B1), none-found 18, no-data 2 (A2, C3), not-applicable 1 (B2), unchecked 12 (A3, A5 to A8, B8, C4 to C6 and the three experimental E1 to E3). Leads: 1 (`lead_20261005_BLR_1`, B9). Sources read: the President's site, the Foreign Minister's General Debate statements of the 78th to 81st sessions (Russian, searched for Gaza, Palestine, Israel and the Middle East and read around each hit; Wayback captures of the 78th and 79th, a direct request for the 80th and 81st), the Foreign Ministry's and the President's statements as press report them, UNRWA's donor tables (no row). No event: the Foreign Minister's statements mention Palestine in lists and, in 2024, a humanitarian catastrophe, with no call for a ceasefire; the President's interview of 15 June 2026 and his message of 29 November 2023 call for a Palestinian state and criticise Israel's conduct without a call for a ceasefire; the Ministry's statement of 13 October 2025 is a press secretary's (R3). Belarus is not an EU member, so the Council's listings do not apply, and no archived joint statement names it. 90-minute stop note: finished inside the budget (about 5 minutes on Belarus). The Foreign Ministry's own pages were not read (search excerpts and press relays only); the President's interview of 15 June 2026 was not read in full.

### Moldova

Assessments: has-events 2 (B1, C2), none-found 18, no-data 2 (A2, C3), not-applicable 1 (B2), unchecked 11 (A3, A5 to A8, C4 to C6, E1 to E3). Leads: 2 (`lead_20261005_MDA_1`, C2; `_2`, B10). Sources read: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' releases, the Embassy in Israel's page of the bilateral legal framework (archived: it lists every instrument with its date of signature, which decided the four C2 events), the Government's release on the driving-licence agreement (Wayback capture), MOLDPRES, Radio Moldova, Radio Chișinău, Europa Liberă Moldova, the General Debate statements of the 79th and 80th sessions (English, searched: no passage on Gaza), UNRWA's donor tables (no row) and web searches in English and Romanian per indicator group. Moldova is not an EU member and no archived joint statement names it. 90-minute stop note: finished inside the budget (about 10 minutes on Moldova). The Foreign Minister's, the President's and the Prime Minister's own statements on Gaza after October 2023 were searched and none that qualifies was found; the 78th and 81st General Debate statements could not be read.

### Romania

Assessments: has-events 9 (A4, B1, B9, B11, C2, D1, D2, D3, D4), none-found 10, no-data 2 (A2, C3), not-applicable 1 (B2), unchecked 12 (A3, A5 to A8, B8, C4 to C6, E1 to E3). Leads: 4 (`lead_20261005_ROU_1`, B9; `_2`, B6; `_3`, D3; `_4`, D4). Romania is an EU member: the Council's three settler listings are filed as B11 under R8 and the two joint statements already archived that name it as B9 (the declaration of 26 EU foreign ministers of 19 February 2024; the leaders' statement of 6 June 2024, signed for Romania by the President), as for Bulgaria (docs/10 B-519). The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (mae.ro) and the Presidency answer every scripted request, and their Wayback captures, with a bot check: the Ministry's releases are known through the outlets that quote them, and the Ministry of Health, the Inspectorate for Emergency Situations and the Government answer normally. 90-minute stop note: finished inside the budget (about 25 minutes on Romania, ten archived pages). Not filed and why: the Foreign Minister's General Debate statement of 27 September 2025 (the UN's file cannot be archived: Save Page Now answers 405 and Wayback holds no capture), B5/B6 for the Ministry's message of 22 November 2024 and the Prime Minister's invitation to Mr Netanyahu of January 2025 (no position on executing the warrants; no visit), the twelve medical-evacuation flights after the first (one programme, one D4 event).

### Score effects (provisional)

`pnpm score --country X --preview` on 2026-10-05 (methodology 1.0.0-rc.1), the 15 reviewed events scored as if published; before them the score was +3 (Acting) for Belarus, −6 (Passive) for Moldova and −13 (Passive) for Romania.

| Country | Before | With the reviewed events | Band | What moves it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BLR | +3 | +3 | Acting | no event; the passivity penalty (−15) applies |
| MDA | −6 | −11 | Passive | C2 −40 clipped to the category cap of −20; the passivity penalty (−15) no longer applies, the tourism declaration of 9 September 2026 being a qualifying event |
| ROU | −13 | +5 | Acting | B11 +5.0, D3 restored +2.0 (reported, weight 0.4), C2 −4.0 (reported), B9 0.0 (decayed); the passivity penalty (−15) no longer applies, the Council's listing of 28 May 2026 being a qualifying event |

One band change: Romania moves from Passive to Acting. Without the 28 May 2026 listing, which adds no points beside the 2024 listing (one event per tier), the penalty would apply and the score would be about −10 (Passive): the band rests on the EU listing counted under R8, as it does for Bulgaria and the 15 EU members among the 45 (B-446, B-519). Moldova's score falls by 5 points although its passivity penalty is lifted, because four C2 events reach the category cap on instruments some readers would not count (B-526): any two of the four reach the cap, and the tourism declaration of 9 September 2026, the only one inside 365 days, lifts the penalty (without it the score would be about −26). No other cap is hit.
