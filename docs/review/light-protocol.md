# P-21 light protocol: the description of the review (PR #11)

The P-21 sessions (PROMPTS.md "P-21", three countries per session) do not open one pull request each. Every session commits to `data/phase1` and appends its summary here, so that the author reviews the whole dataset in PR #11 (docs/10 B-500). Each section has a table of the events the session filed (event id, indicator, date, points, confidence, the kind of the first source), then, per country, the assessment counts and the 90-minute stop note. Every event is at status `reviewed`; none is published, and no `review.reviewed_by` is set. Scores quoted are `pnpm score --preview` figures on the unpublished events and are provisional.

## T-P21-01: NZL, KAZ, KGZ (2026-10-05)

Light protocol (docs/06 §5) for New Zealand, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. 19 events: 13 for New Zealand, 5 for Kazakhstan, 1 for Kyrgyzstan. Decisions and flags are in docs/10 B-500 to B-507.

Points are the tier points before decay and weights. B1, D1 and the other generated indicators are left to the build.

### New Zealand

Assessments (34 indicators): has-events 6 (B1, B5, B9, B11, D1, D3), none-found 16, no-data 2 (A2, C3), not-applicable 1 (B2), unchecked 9 (A3, A5, A7, A8, C2, C6 and the three experimental E1 to E3). Leads: 1 (`lead_20261005_NZL_1`, B9). Sources read: the Ministry's page with its frequently asked questions (archived), the Beehive releases and transcripts (through Wayback captures), the General Debate statements, and the joint statements already archived for the 45 (7 of them name New Zealand). The EU Council listings do not apply. 90-minute stop note: the work finished inside the budget (about 45 minutes in all for the three countries, 25 of them on New Zealand); nothing was cut for time except what the protocol does not search (A3, A5, A7, A8, C2, C6).

### Kazakhstan

Assessments: has-events 5 (B1, B9, C2, D1, D3), none-found 13, no-data 2 (A2, C3), not-applicable 1 (B2), unchecked 13 (A3, A5 to A8, B8, C1, C4 to C6, E1 to E3). Leads: 1 (`lead_20261005_KAZ_1`, C2 and D4, D5 notes). Joint statements: none of the statements already archived names Kazakhstan. 90-minute stop note: finished inside the budget (about 10 minutes on Kazakhstan). The Ministry's releases cannot be archived as text (B-501): the C2 events rest on two press reports at `corroborated`.

### Kyrgyzstan

Assessments: has-events 2 (B1, B9), none-found 16, no-data 2 (A2, C3), not-applicable 1 (B2), unchecked 13 (A3, A5 to A8, B8, C1, C4 to C6, E1 to E3). Leads: 1 (`lead_20261005_KGZ_1`, B9). Joint statements: none of the statements already archived names Kyrgyzstan. 90-minute stop note: finished inside the budget (about 8 minutes on Kyrgyzstan). Neither the Ministry's site (HTTP 502 to scripted requests) nor the President's site (script-loaded) could be read directly.

### Score effects (provisional)

`pnpm score --country X --preview` on 2026-10-05 (methodology 1.0.0-rc.1), the 19 reviewed events scored as if published; before them the generated indicators alone gave +3 (Acting) for each of the three countries.

| Country | Before (generated only) | With the reviewed events | Band | What moves it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NZL | +3 | +37 | Acting | B5 +8, B11 +10, D3 +8, B9 +7.9 (the statements of 2025), passivity penalty (−15) applied: no qualifying event in the last 365 days |
| KAZ | +3 | +14 | Acting | C2 −14 (two events at weight 0.7), D3 +8, B9 +2.0; the C2 events are qualifying, so the passivity penalty (−15) no longer applies |
| KGZ | +3 | +7 | Acting | B9 +4.9, passivity penalty (−15) still applied |

No band changes. One reading to note for the author: Kazakhstan's two C2 events (−14 in all) end its passivity penalty (+15), so the score with them is 1 point above the score without them (B-504 (2)).

## T-P21-02: TJK, TKM, UZB (2026-10-05)

Light protocol (docs/06 §5) for Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. 8 events: 3 for Tajikistan, none for Turkmenistan, 5 for Uzbekistan. Decisions and flags are in docs/10 B-508 to B-514.

| Event id | Ind. | Date | Points | Confidence | Source kind |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| evt_2024_09_24_TJK_B9 | B9 | 2024-09-24 | +2 | confirmed | official |
| evt_2025_09_18_TJK_C2 | C2 | 2025-09-18 | −10 | confirmed | official |
| evt_2025_09_23_TJK_B9 | B9 | 2025-09-23 | +2 | confirmed | official |

Points are the tier points before decay and weights. B1, D1 and the other generated indicators are left to the build.

### Tajikistan

Assessments (34 indicators): has-events 3 (B1, B9, C2), none-found 16, no-data 2 (A2, C3), not-applicable 1 (B2), unchecked 12 (A3, A5 to A8, B8, C4 to C6 and the three experimental E1 to E3). Leads: 2 (`lead_20261005_TJK_1`, B9; `lead_20261005_TJK_2`, B5). Sources read: the Ministry's English pages (news, statements of 2025 and 2026, the President's speeches), the General Debate statements of the 79th and 80th sessions, the UN's transcript of the 81st session's Day 5 sitting, the Israeli Government's news item on the tourism visit. The EU Council listings do not apply and no archived joint statement names Tajikistan. 90-minute stop note: finished inside the budget (about 30 minutes on Tajikistan). The Foreign Minister's call for a lasting ceasefire at the 81st session (26 September 2026) is in the UN's transcript, which the archiver truncates before that passage, and the Ministry's own page is a summary without it: a lead, not an event (B-509).

### Turkmenistan

Assessments: has-events 1 (B1), none-found 18, no-data 2 (A2, C3), not-applicable 1 (B2), unchecked 12 (A3, A5 to A8, B8, C4 to C6, E1 to E3). Leads: 1 (`lead_20261005_TKM_1`, B9). No event: the General Debate statements read (the Foreign Minister's of 2024, the President's of 2025) have no passage on Gaza, and the Ministry's statements of 2026 concern Iran. No archived joint statement names Turkmenistan; the EU Council listings do not apply. 90-minute stop note: finished inside the budget (about 12 minutes on Turkmenistan).

### Uzbekistan

Assessments: has-events 4 (B1, B9, D1, D3), none-found 15, no-data 2 (A2, C3), not-applicable 1 (B2), unchecked 12 (A3, A5 to A8, B8, C4 to C6, E1 to E3). Leads: 2 (`lead_20261005_UZB_1`, B6; `lead_20261005_UZB_2`, D4). No archived joint statement names Uzbekistan; the EU Council listings do not apply. 90-minute stop note: finished inside the budget (about 25 minutes on Uzbekistan). The President's site publishes the full English texts of his addresses, which is why four of the five events rest on it.

### Score effects (provisional)

`pnpm score --country X --preview` on 2026-10-05 (methodology 1.0.0-rc.1), the 8 reviewed events scored as if published; before them the generated indicators alone gave +3 (Acting) for Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and −2 (Passive) for Turkmenistan.

| Country | Before (generated only) | With the reviewed events | Band | What moves it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TJK | +3 | −5 | Passive | C2 −10, B9 +2.0 (the statement of 2025; that of 2024 has decayed to zero), passivity penalty (−15) applied: no qualifying event in the last 365 days |
| TKM | −2 | −2 | Passive | no event; the passivity penalty (−15) applies |
| UZB | +3 | +7 | Acting | B9 +4.2 (2024, July and September 2025), D3 ended on 2024-12-31 and no longer counts, passivity penalty (−15) applied |

One band change: Tajikistan moves from Acting to Passive on the C2 event. Two unfiled items would each end a passivity penalty: the Tajik Foreign Minister's statement of 26 September 2026 (a lead, +2 and a qualifying event: the score would be about +12) and, for Uzbekistan, nothing found within 365 days that meets the evidence rule. Read critically (docs/06 §4 step 7): no cap is hit; the bands rest on one tourism instrument for Tajikistan (B-510 (2)).
